# Hooks

This directory contains hooks for the calculator plugin.

Hooks allow you to run custom code at specific points during Claude Code execution. Define your hooks in a `hooks.json` file and specify which events should trigger them.

For more information about hooks, see the [official hooks documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) or the plugin-template/hooks/README.md for detailed examples.
