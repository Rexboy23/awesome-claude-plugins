# Hooks

This directory contains lifecycle hooks for the calculator plugin.

Hooks allow you to run custom code at specific points in the plugin lifecycle:
- `on_load.sh` - Runs when the plugin is loaded
- `on_unload.sh` - Runs when the plugin is unloaded
- `on_enable.sh` - Runs when the plugin is enabled
- `on_disable.sh` - Runs when the plugin is disabled
